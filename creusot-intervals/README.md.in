Verified interval logic for [Creusot](https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot) proofs.

Provides logic functions and lemmas for reasoning about byte ranges (half-open intervals)
in deductive verification. Used by trame's CRuntime to prove initialization tracking is correct.

This crate is not published—it exists solely to support Creusot proofs.
