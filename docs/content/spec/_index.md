# Specification Overview

This specification is split into focused sections:

- `ops.md`: Trame operation/state-machine semantics.
- `vm-ir.md`: generic format VM IR contract for both encoding and decoding.
- `exec-jit.md`: execution engine and JIT semantics.

Conventions:

- Normative requirements are written as blockquote rules: `t[...]`.
- Informative text explains intent and examples.
