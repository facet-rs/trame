# Trame Specification

This document specifies the behavior of trame, a library for safe, verified
partial construction of Rust values using facet reflection.

## Conventions

This spec uses **MUST** to indicate normative requirements. Normative
requirements appear in blockquotes with a rule identifier (e.g. `r[...]`).
All other text is informative. Rule of thumb: if you can't write a test for
it, it's not a rule.

## Background

### Primer: Facet Shapes

Facet provides comprehensive reflection over Rust types via `&'static Shape`.
A `Shape` exposes:
- Identity: stable-in-compilation type IDs (`id`, `decl_id`)
- Layout: size and alignment (enough to allocate uninitialized memory)
- Operations: drop/default/clone via vtables and `type_ops`
- Type category: `ty` plus a `def` that enables struct/enum/list/map access
- Field/variant access: per-field offsets and per-field shapes for structs
- Marker traits: Copy/Send/Sync and related flags
- Names and location: type name, module path, source file/line/column
- Generics and metadata: type params, docs, custom attributes
- Serialization hints: tags, rename, proxy types, format proxies
- Wrappers/builders: `inner` newtype shape, optional builder shape
- Variance and flags: variance description and common attribute flags

Trame primarily relies on layout, field access, and drop/default operations,
but the full `Shape` is available for higher-level tooling.

### Primer: Rust Memory Operations

Rust exposes low-level memory operations (alloc/dealloc, pointer arithmetic,
`copy_nonoverlapping`, `drop_in_place`) that operate on untyped bytes. These
operations are powerful but unsafe without strict invariants. For the reflection
side of the story, see the Primer: Facet Shapes.

### Design Goal

By combining facet reflection with low-level memory operations, trame aims to
make incremental construction of arbitrary Rust values possible without causing
UB or otherwise unsoundness. The API surface is intentionally small and
verified.

### Mental Model: A Tree of Nodes

A partially built value is modeled as a tree of nodes. Each node represents a
subshape at a specific pointer (often an offset into the same allocation).
Nested nodes are not separately allocated; they are offsets into the parent
allocation. The root node is the entry point for construction.

## Normative Specification

### Terminology

Allocate means reserving memory in the uninitialized state. Initialize means
transitioning a byte range to initialized. Drop means transitioning a byte
range back to uninitialized for the given shape.

Nodes are **Staged** or **Sealed**. Staged nodes can be mutated; sealed nodes
are finalized. A node is **structurally complete** when all of its fields are
initialized directly or via sealed child nodes.

### Tree model

Trame models construction as a tree of nodes with a cursor pointing at the
current node. Building a `u32` is the simplest case: the tree has a single
root node, and a single `Set` initializes that node. Once the root node is
initialized, it is complete and the build can finish; there are no child nodes
or cursor moves involved.

For structs, construction is still a tree but now includes child nodes per
field. You can initialize fields directly or step into a field to build it
incrementally, then use `End` to seal that node and move the cursor back to the
parent. In strict mode, `End` acts as early validation: it requires that the
current node is structurally complete before sealing. Smart pointers follow
the same mental model, but the node representing the pointer owns its own
allocation, and sealing the pointer implies its inner value has been fully
constructed.

## Verification Abstractions

Trame is parameterized over a small set of interfaces so the same construction
logic can run against a real implementation or a verified one. This is how the
project proves safety properties without changing core logic.

### Shape

Production uses `&'static Shape`. Verification uses a bounded dynamic shape
store that implements the same `IShape` interface. The point of `IShape` is to
let `Trame` and `Heap` operate over “a shape” without caring whether it is a
real static shape or a generated one.

Dynamic shapes exist to generate arbitrary shapes for verification. Without
them, tests are limited to the finite set of shapes present in the program at
compile time. The previous fuzzing approach in trame declared many static types
and hoped for enough coverage; dynamic shapes replace that with true shape
generation.

The shape store indirection (handles into a store) allows recursive shapes
without recursive Rust types, and enables `Arbitrary` generation of bounded
shape graphs.

### Heap

`Heap` defines the memory operations used by construction:
- `alloc`
- `dealloc`
- `memcpy`
- `mark_init`
- `drop_in_place`
- `is_init`

The verified heap tracks, per allocation:
- which shape was allocated
- which byte ranges are initialized

### Arena

The arena is also abstracted for verification. Production uses a growable
arena; verification uses a fixed-size arena with explicit occupancy checks.

### Zero-Cost Swap

The `Trame` type is instantiated with either the real implementations or the
verified ones. This makes verification a compile-time swap with zero runtime
cost in production builds.
