AFL fuzzing harness for [trame](https://github.com/facet-rs/trame).

Exercises the `Trame::apply`/`build` API with random operation sequences against a wide
variety of target types (scalars, structs, enums, collections, nested options/results).

Supports three modes:

- **AFL mode** (default) - Runs under AFL's fork server for coverage-guided fuzzing
- **Standalone mode** (`--features standalone`) - For reproducing crashes and running under Miri
- **Coverage mode** - LLVM source coverage via `cargo-llvm-cov`

Fuzz entry points:

- `trame-fuzz` (existing): `LRuntime<&'static Shape>`
- `vshape` (new): `LRuntime<VShapeView<'static, VShapeStore>>`

Run with:

- `just fuzz` for the existing target
- `just fuzz-vshape` for the new VShape target
