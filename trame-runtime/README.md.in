Runtime traits and implementations for [trame](https://github.com/facet-rs/trame).

Defines the `IRuntime`, `IHeap`, `IShape`, `IPtr`, and `IArena` traits that abstract
over memory operations, allowing trame's core logic to be verified with multiple backends:

- **LRuntime** (Live Runtime) - Real memory operations via `std::alloc`. Zero-cost in production.
- **VRuntime** (Verified Runtime) - Bounded state tracking for Kani model checking. Fixed-size
  arrays, fat pointers with allocation tracking, explicit byte-range initialization tracking.
- **CRuntime** (Creusot Runtime) - Backend for deductive verification with Creusot/Why3.
