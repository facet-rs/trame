# trame-toy-postcard

Toy postcard deserializer built on trame primitives.

This crate exists as a vertical slice for the first `trame` format pipeline
deliverable:

- compile a shape into an input-independent decode program;
- interpret that program over postcard bytes;
- build values through `trame` operations/runtime.
